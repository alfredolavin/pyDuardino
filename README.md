# pyDuardino

A very simple "plugin" to add javascript like syntax to python. The project has my sons name and It was specifically developed to use python one-liners as a bash script substitute. You can do almost anything through the CLI with it.

My motivation was very clear:

1) Python IS the perfect programming languaje
Therefor, all things most provide a Python interface.
2) Bash does not provide such interface.
3) We must use pyEduardino to provide it.

I hope Gu*do van Ross*m forgive me for tainting the sacred languaje with some javascript's like heretics.

My humble addition is only to simplify onliners and some database programming.

The code was inspired from a stackoverflow answer which i couldn't find to give it propper credit.
